## Prototype

Our first prototype is a 15:1 model. Despite popsicle sticks not being exactly proportional to the 2x4s we will use for the final product, we used our Onshape model to scale the dimensions as accurately as possible. 

<b>Dimensions:</b>

Base: 11.8cm x 7.2cm 

Height of frame : 11.1 cm

Height with arm fully extended: 21.8 cm

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/prototype1.jpg" height="300"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/prototype2.jpg" height="300"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/prototype3.jpg" height="300"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/prototype4.jpg" height="300">

We used a battery as the counterweight and attached it to the arm. The projectile was a small ball of paper covered in hot glue. One issue with prototyping with popsicle sticks was getting the arms of the frame to be exactly 30 degrees from the vertical. Because of this, we had to adjust the base dimensions and therefore they are not directly proportional to the base size we will use for the actual trebuchet. 

Our initial sliphook (a piece of wire) was too long which caused the sling to release too late. Our final sliphook was much shorter and was at about a 45 degree angle. The key was getting the sling to release before the arm was completely vertical at 0 degrees. 

We also had issues with the sling, because the pouch to hold the projectile was made of paper. Because the pouch did not really form around the projectile, it would slip out immediately. This problem should be solved with the actual trebuchet because the pouch will be made out of cloth. 

With the final product, our plan is to use stop collars to stop the trebuchet arm from moving horizontally along the axis. For the prototype, we put some hot glue on the axle (a q-tip stick) to minimize walking. 

## Frame

#### Initial design

Floating A-frame from pine 2x4 boards. Frame approximately 2m high excluding height of arm. 

Onshape Model: 09.27.22 : approximately 140lbs, 64in

### Gusset Plates

#### Use + Design on Onshape

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/gusset.PNG" height="300">

We used 1/4 in plywood, cut with table saw and chop saw. We had to shorten them from the initial planned length in order to use plywood that was already available in the lab. 

Here is Lucy using the chop saw:

<b>Final Product</b>

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/IMG-0898.jpg" height="300">

### Body

Our planned dimensions for the base are 31.5 x 59.25 in. We found that plywood was very expensive and buying a 4 x 8 ft piece of 3/4 in plywood would be more than half our budget. The revised plan is to use a 3 x 4 ft piece of plywood and then another smaller piece glued together and add more braces on the bottom. We should be able to find those sizes in the lab

We finished staining all of our pieces. It took us a long time because the stain had to dry over night and we couldn't do all sides at once. We also had to work outside on the loading dock because of the fumes from the wood stain. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-11-08%20at%208.39.23%20PM.png" height="300">

There is always some slight warping in 2x4s but we used a square frequently to check that all the angles were as close to 90 degrees as possible. We started with an H shape to get the foundation of the trebuchet frame before we attached it to the base. Shown below is a picture of the frame H standing by itself. We used a hack saw to cut through the pipe for the axle, which was time and labor-consuming. For other pipe pieces we need, we may end up using the chop saw instead. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-11-08%20at%208.39.36%20PM.png" height="300">

The screws we got were 3in and went through both 2x4s, so the tip of the screw poked out on the other side. We had to use the dremel to remove them. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-11-11%20at%2012.21.08%20PM.png" height="300">

The lengths of the angled pieces were not perfect, as the chop saw was not easy to get exact angles, but it fit together well. The frame is very stable in all directions. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-11-11%20at%2012.21.19%20PM.png" height="300">

The casters were attached last, and the trebuchet is very easy to move around. We used two 5 in casters in the back and two 5 in wheels in the front. We decided to put the wheels in the front, because when it lauches it will move a bit, and we dont want it to be able to move in more than one direction. 

<img src="images/trebuchet_wheels.jpg" height="300">

Jan 3: We took the trebuchet outside to test the arm and bumper together. As we were rolling it back inside, part of the base cracked. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/image_67174657%20(1).JPG" height="200"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/image_67203585%20(1).JPG" height="200">

Our base was made from two pieces: a large piece of high quality plywood and a piece of scrap that we found in the lab. The piece of scrap cracked along the grain despite the supports we put underneath it. We think it was because of the poor quality of the wood (which admittedly was warped). Instead of replacing the plank, we used clamps to glue the pieces back together. Because people in the lab don't seem to understand how to use or store glue, the wood glue was almost completely solid. To glue up the crack we used a combination of liquid wood glue and the glue putty that was remaining in the tube, which we used like caulk. The top side of the base (the side that is visible), now has a long white line in it which is unfortunate. We will try and cover it up in some way so that the appearance of the stain is not ruined. We also added additional supports out of planks of wood to the bottom, reinforcing both sides of the crack. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/image_67164417.JPG" height="200"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/image_67217665.JPG" height="200"> 

## Arm and Counterweight

We had some issues with our materials which took awhile to figure out. The ball bearings we ordered were slightly too big for the axle, so we had to 3D print inserts so that the bearings would be friction fit to the pipe. The fit was very tight and we had to hammer it on. The hole cutter we used with the drill press also cut a hole that was slightly too large, so we ended up having to glue the bearings into the arm. To give the bearings extra support, we cut gussetts out of plywood and drilled them into the arm. Bottom left is the part in onshape, and bottom right is the part in use. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-12-06%20at%2011.19.58%20AM.png" height="300"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/image_16853761.JPG" height="300"> 

Because we didn't have a substantial amount of money left in our budget, we decided to 3D stop collars instead of buying them. Our initial design is pictured below. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-12-06%20at%2011.08.21%20AM.png" height="200">

We used D rings to attach the ropes going from the frame to the arm. Our plan is for the ropes to prevent the arm from moving 180 degrees. Once it reaches 90 degrees, the ropes will become taut and the arm will be brought back down. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/image_67172609.JPG" height="300">

We tested some rudimentary ideas for a bumper using materials in the lab. As of Jan 7th, the plan is to have a rubber bumper for the arm to come down on. Our hope is it will take strain off of the arm and the frame. Our initial design was using foam, as suggested by Mr. Miller. The material is shown below. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/image_16887809.JPG" height="200">

It was not very successful. We only used duct tape to hold it down, which of course was not a long-term solution, but still we threw the idea out. The frame was still taking a lot of shock, and the arm was cutting into the foam, which did not reform. Then we tried cutting up RC car wheels that were sitting unused in the lab. That is shown below. There are clear gouges in the sliphook plate on the arm, which came from it being just slightly wider than the 2x4. We will likely have to recut it, possibly even with thicker plywood. As for the tire bumper, it was better than the foam, but still not as successful as we hoped. We may try a combination of foam and tire, or get more serious scrap tires with thicker rubber. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/image_67232513.JPG" height="200"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/image_67509505.JPG" height="200">

We ended up using two types of foam with RC car wheels stretched on top, which we then bolted onto the side of the trebuchet. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/image_67179265.JPG" height="300"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/image_67222017.JPG" height="300">

When we tested our arm it worked very well, and appears to be nearly frictionless.

## Release mechanism + Sling

### Sliphook and release

Our initial design in Onshape for the sliphook is pictured below. We designed it such that the angle of the sliphook can be changed to modify the launch. Otherwise, it would be much more difficult to make small changes once we are in the launch-test phase. Our plan is to cut the plate out of plywood and 3D print the actual hook.

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-12-06%20at%2011.30.30%20AM.png" height="300"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-12-06%20at%2011.30.43%20AM.png" height="300">

We made our initial cut out of 5mm plywood. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/image_67163393.JPG" height="300">

Unfortunately, as we were testing a bumper for the arm, it became clear that we made a poor choice in wood. The balsa got chewed up very quickly, and we decided that it would not be a good long-term solution. Because we are graduating and leaving Mr. Manning to deal with the trebuchet, we want to minimize the parts that he has to replace. We were also having issues with getting the sliphook tight enough. It turned out that the nut and bolt were just cutting into the wood, so it wasn't able to tighten as much as we wanted. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/image_67187969.JPG" height="300"> 

We ended up cutting a new sliphook plate out of metal using the waterjet. The sliphook is now very firm and stays in place. We are also considering cutting the sliphook itself out of metal instead of 3D printed plastic.

### Sling

We used [this](https://ourpastimes.com/make-trebuchet-sling-pouch-8537305.html) website to help us design our sling. 

## Weekly Reports

<b>10.3.22 - 10.7.22</b>: We built a 15:1 scale [prototype](https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/README.md#prototype) out of popsicle sticks. Although we were using popsicle sticks, which don't directly translate to 2x4s, we used our onshape model to try and make the dimensions as accurate as possible. The end result launched a small projectile about 25 in. Our main issue was adjusting the slip hook so the sling would release at the correct time (at approx 45 degrees). We used a battery as the counterweight, so we tried using a slightly smaller counterweight, but this caused additional issues because it would not stay in the sling. This problem should be less of an issue with the full scale trebuchet, because we will be using cloth for the sling instead of paper, which didn't form around the projectile. 

<b> 10.10.22 - 10.14.22</b>: This week, we cut the gussets for the full scale trebuchet and finalized our cut list. We talked to our teachers about how we are going to get materials for the trebuchet from Lowe's while spending within the school's system, and had conversations about using materials from the lab. This led us to modify our design slightly to include support connectors so that we can use multiple pieces of plywood for the base, since the size of plywood sheet we would've needed for the base would have been very expensive. Our estimate for costs of wood and fasteners is about $60 to $65. 

<b> 10.17.22 - 10.21.22</b>: We got our wood from Lowes and cut it to the sizes we needed. We also got screws and a mahogany stain, which was approved by Mr. Manning.  Our total cost for fasteners, wood, and stain was about $83. We were able to cut all of our 2x4s and plywood, and have begun sanding and staining our pieces. The stain needs to set for 5 hours per coat and needs 2 coats, so the staining process will probably take a couple more classes, especially as we are working in the back hallway. We also might have to stain outside in the future, which will take significant amounts of time to move pieces in and out. 

<b> 10.24.22 - 10.26.22</b>: We continued staining this week. All of our wood has now been sanded, so we are ready to stain the remainder of our pieces. Since it was only a three day week, we could only get so much done in two classes. 

<b> 10.31.22 - 11.4.22</b>: This week we were able to start building the frame of the trebuchet. The base has been assembled apart from the wheels, and the upright supports have been put together and stand on their own. We made a slight change to the base design, and are now planning on including triangular support blocks that will attach the base to the vertical braces, improving stability and giving the vertical pieces a stronger connection to the base. All staining has been finished. Next week, we will continue to add to the frame and work on attaching it to the base. 

<b> 11.9.22 - 11.11.22</b>: This week continued building the frame of the trebuchet, and got everything attached to the base. We are basically done with the frame, we just have to attach the gussets. We are ahead of schedule and will likely start working on the arm next week. We only had two days to work this week, but we got a lot done. 

<b> 11.14.22 - 11.18.22</b>: We attached the gussets and put the wheels on the trebuchet. Thankfully, it fits through the door! We got casters from theater tech, but were only able to find three matching ones, so the trebuchet is a little bit unstable at the moment. We are hoping to get similarly sized wheels to put on the back, and we have ordered bearings for the arm. These will hopefully arrive sometime next week, but we are essentially done with the frame, putting us right on schedule. 

<b> 11.28.22 - 12.2.22</b>: This week we got the bearings into the arm. This took slightly longer than expected. We drilled 2in holes into a piece of test wood, which fit the bearings very wel once the wood cooled. However, when we drilled holes of the same diameter into the arm itself, the bearings slid right through. We ended up having to glue them, and printed a small spacer to keep them from sliding towards the center of the beam. We also found that the piping was only nominally the size of the interior diameter of the bearing, and in reality was slightly narrower. The offset was a little less than 1mm in radius, so we printed inserts. Using these, we were able to friction fit the pieces on and fix the arm on its axis very well. We also cut small pieces of plywood to secure the bearings, so all we have left to do to finish the arm is attach those and stain it. 

<b> 12.4.22 - 12.9.22</b>: This week we stained the arm. We also 3D printed stop collars for the pipe that will hold the counterweight plates. Because we are still waiting on our last two wheels, and we haven't gotten the weight plates yet, we began working on the sliphook mechanism. We laser cut the plate with the adjustable slot for the sliphook, which we also 3D printed. The adjustable sliphook angle is very useful, but we may have to find a way to secure it more tightly, because the bolt doesn't hold it perfectly.  

<b> 12.12.22 - 12.16.22</b>: We received the wheels this week and attached them to the trebuchet. They work really well and are pretty much exactly the same height as the casters so the base isn't uneven which is great. We finished up the slip hook assembly and secured the use of weights from PE. They were willing to loan us two 25 pound weights, so we now have a total of 50 pounds rather than the 40 we were expecting. This allows us to use slightly heavier projectiles. The arm is now done and we have gotten the weights and the slip hook, putting us right on our schedule of having the arm finished at the end of December and ahead of schedule for the launch and release mechanisms. 

<b> 01.03.23 - 01.06.23</b>: This week we took the trebuchet outside for bumper testing. We decided to cut up small rubber tires to make the bumper, which worked quite well and is very effective at minimizing the impact of the base on the arm when it drops. However, as we were wheeling the trebuchet back into the school, we had a split in the base, which derailed our plans for the rest of the week as we had to reinforce the base. The smaller (and worse quality) piece of plywood that we added on to the base split the short length of the base, so we glued it back together and reinforced the seam with three pieces of plywood. We also ran into some problems getting the trebuchet frame through the door. Most doors to the exterior in the school have a post in the middle of double doors. Because of this, the post needs to be taken out before the trebuchet can go through, because for some reason the doors to the outside are narrower than the interior doors. 

<b> 01.10.23 - 01.13.23</b>: This week we finished a more permanent bumper made from a combination of foams and the cut up tires. We then screwed this into the side of the trebuchet. Since the plate holding the slip hook had taken quite a bit of damage both from initial bumper testing and just people lifting the arm in the lab, we decided to cut a slighty thinner plate in wood originally to check the size and fit and then in metal to ensure it survives the onslaught of Mr. Manning's junior classes. We got to use the water jet, which was very cool but a little bit complicated. We also borrowed smaller weights with a 1in diameter, which fit on the pole we have a lot better than the 25lb weights we borrowed from PE. We only have 35lbs in total with the smaller weights, but we will probably test with this slightly smaller weight since we'll be launching lighter objects like tenis balls to start off with. 

<b> 01.24.23 - 01.27.23</b>: Last week was the end of the quarter so we presented a summary of our progress so far this year. We also started making the sling. This week, we got 40lbsof 10lb weights, meaning the bar is a little bit more balanced and we have the weight we were expecting to launch with. We finished the sling and put grommets where the string ties on to make sure the string doesn't tear through the sling on launch. We were even able to test launch on Thursday and Friday, which was very exciting and surprisingly quite successful - our sling worked quite well and we were able to start to change the angle of the release hook and see a difference in launch distance. We will document test launches, changes we make, and results [below](https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/README.md#launch). 


# Projectile

Work in progress - documentation [here](https://github.com/lgray52/Pi-in-the-Sky_Projectile). 

# Launch

<b>1.26.23.</b> Today was our first launch. It went pretty smoothly compared to expectations. The ball stayed in the pouch until release, and we had minimal issues with the weights sliding off. We don't have our hose clamps yet so there is nothing keeping the weights on the arm. All of our releases were a bit late, as you can see in the drawing below. The variables we are experimenting with for launch are projectile mass, sling length, sliphook angle, and the pouch. Today we just wanted to see if it would work, but going forward we will be more exact and measure the angle of the sliphook with a protractor. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/IMG-1953.jpg" height="300"> 

<b>1.27.23.</b> Today we started using a compass to measure the angle of the sliphook. Below is how we quantified negative vs positive positions. 

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202023-01-27%20at%2012.38.03.png" height="150">

<b>-10°</b>

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/l1.png" height="300">

At ten degrees, the ball was released much earlier than we wanted and went almost straight up. 

<b>-20°</b>

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/l2.png" height="300">

To further decide if we wanted to use a positive angle, we made the angle more steeply negative. The ball went straight up again. 

<b>13°</b>

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/l3.png" height="300">

This was the test that was the most successful. We think it went approximately 50 yards. 

<b>20°</b>

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/l3.png" height="300">

This one went a shorter distance, so we definitely don't want a higher angle than 20 degrees.
