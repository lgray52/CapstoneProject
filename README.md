## Prototype

Our first prototype is a 15:1 model. Despite popsicle sticks not being exactly proportional to the 2x4s we will use for the final product, we used our Onshape model to scale the dimensions as accurately as possible. 

<b>Dimensions:</b>

Base: 11.8cm x 7.2cm 

Height of frame : 11.1 cm

Height with arm fully extended: 21.8 cm

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/prototype1.jpg" height="300"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/prototype2.jpg" height="300"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/prototype3.jpg" height="300"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/prototype4.jpg" height="300">

We used a battery as the counterweight and attached it to the arm. The projectile was a small ball of paper covered in hot glue. One issue with prototyping with popsicle sticks was getting the arms of the frame to be exactly 30 degrees from the vertical. Because of this, we had to adjust the base dimensions and therefore they are not directly proportional to the base size we will use for the actual trebuchet. 

Our initial sliphook (a piece of wire) was too long which caused the sling to release too late. Our final sliphook was much shorter and was at about a 45 degree angle. The key was getting the sling to release before the arm was completely vertical at 0 degrees. 

We also had issues with the sling, because the pouch to hold the projectile was made of paper. Because the pouch did not really form around the projectile, it would slip out immediately. This problem should be solved with the actual trebuchet because the pouch will be made out of cloth. 

With the final product, our plan is to use stop collars to stop the trebuchet arm from moving horizontally along the axis. For the prototype, we put some hot glue on the axle (a q-tip stick) to minimize walking. 

## Frame

#### Initial design

Floating A-frame from pine 2x4 boards. Frame approximately 2m high excluding height of arm.

### Gusset Plates

#### Use + Design on Onshape

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/gusset.PNG" height="300">

We used 1/4 in plywood, cut with table saw and chop saw. We had to shorten them from the initial planned length in order to use plywood that was already available in the lab. 

Here is Lucy using the chop saw:

<b>Final Product</b>

### Body

Our planned dimensions for the base are 31.5 x 59.25 in. We found that plywood was very expensive and buying a 4 x 8 ft piece of 3/4 in plywood would be more than half our budget. The revised plan is to use a 3 x 4 ft piece of plywood and then another smaller piece glued together and add more braces on the bottom. We should be able to find those sizes in the lab

We finished staining all of our pieces. It took us a long time because the stain had to dry over night and we couldn't do all sides at once. We also had to work outside on the loading dock because of the fumes from the wood stain.

There is always some slight warping in 2x4s but we used a square frequently to check that all the angles were as close to 90 degrees as possible. We started with an H shape to get the foundation of the trebuchet frame before we attached it to the base. Shown below is a picture of the frame H standing by itself. We used a hack saw to cut through the pipe for the axle, which was time and labor-consuming. For other pipe pieces we need, we may end up using the chop saw instead.

The screws we got were 3in and went through both 2x4s, so the tip of the screw poked out on the other side. We had to use the dremel to remove them.

The lengths of the angled pieces were not perfect, as the chop saw was not easy to get exact angles, but it fit together well. The frame is very stable in all directions.

The casters were attached last, and the trebuchet is very easy to move around. We used two 5 in casters in the back and two 5 in wheels in the front. We decided to put the wheels in the front, because when it lauches it will move a bit, and we dont want it to be able to move in more than one direction.

## Arm and Counterweight

We had some issues with our materials which took awhile to figure out. The ball bearings we ordered were slightly too big for the axle, so we had to 3D print inserts so that the bearings would be friction fit to the pipe. The fit was very tight and we had to hammer it on. The hole cutter we used with the drill press also cut a hole that was slightly too large, so we ended up having to glue the bearings into the arm. To give the bearings extra support, we cut gussetts out of plywood and drilled them into the arm. Bottom left is the part in onshape, and bottom right is the part in use.

Because we didn't have a substantial amount of money left in our budget, we decided to 3D stop collars instead of buying them. Our initial design is pictured below.

We used D rings to attach the ropes going from the frame to the arm. Our plan is for the ropes to prevent the arm from moving 180 degrees. Once it reaches 90 degrees, the ropes will become taut and the arm will be brought back down.

## Release mechanism + Sling

### Sliphook and release

Our initial design in Onshape for the sliphook is pictured below. We designed it such that the angle of the sliphook can be changed to modify the launch. Otherwise, it would be much more difficult to make small changes once we are in the launch-test phase. Our plan is to cut the plate out of plywood and 3D print the actual hook.

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-12-06%20at%2011.30.30%20AM.png" height="300"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-12-06%20at%2011.30.43%20AM.png" height="300">

We made our initial cut out of 5mm plywood.

## Weekly Reports

<b>10.3.22 - 10.7.22</b>: We built a 15:1 scale [prototype](https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/README.md#prototype) out of popsicle sticks. Although we were using popsicle sticks, which don't directly translate to 2x4s, we used our onshape model to try and make the dimensions as accurate as possible. The end result launched a small projectile about 25 in. Our main issue was adjusting the slip hook so the sling would release at the correct time (at approx 45 degrees). We used a battery as the counterweight, so we tried using a slightly smaller counterweight, but this caused additional issues because it would not stay in the sling. This problem should be less of an issue with the full scale trebuchet, because we will be using cloth for the sling instead of paper, which didn't form around the projectile. 

<b> 10.10.22 - 10.14.22</b>: This week, we cut the gussets for the full scale trebuchet and finalized our cut list. We talked to our teachers about how we are going to get materials for the trebuchet from Lowe's while spending within the school's system, and had conversations about using materials from the lab. This led us to modify our design slightly to include support connectors so that we can use multiple pieces of plywood for the base, since the size of plywood sheet we would've needed for the base would have been very expensive. Our estimate for costs of wood and fasteners is about $60 to $65. 

<b> 10.17.22 - 10.21.22</b>: We got our wood from Lowes and cut it to the sizes we needed. We also got screws and a mahogany stain, which was approved by Mr. Manning.  Our total cost for fasteners, wood, and stain was about $83. We were able to cut all of our 2x4s and plywood, and have begun sanding and staining our pieces. The stain needs to set for 5 hours per coat and needs 2 coats, so the staining process will probably take a couple more classes, especially as we are working in the back hallway. We also might have to stain outside in the future, which will take significant amounts of time to move pieces in and out. 

<b> 10.24.22 - 10.26.22</b>: We continued staining this week. All of our wood has now been sanded, so we are ready to stain the remainder of our pieces. Since it was only a three day week, we could only get so much done in two classes. 

<b> 10.31.22 - 11.4.22</b>: This week we were able to start building the frame of the trebuchet. The base has been assembled apart from the wheels, and the upright supports have been put together and stand on their own. We made a slight change to the base design, and are now planning on including triangular support blocks that will attach the base to the vertical braces, improving stability and giving the vertical pieces a stronger connection to the base. All staining has been finished. Next week, we will continue to add to the frame and work on attaching it to the base. 

<b> 11.9.22 - 11.11.22</b>: This week continued building the frame of the trebuchet, and got everything attached to the base. We are basically done with the frame, we just have to attach the gussets. We are ahead of schedule and will likely start working on the arm next week. We only had two days to work this week, but we got a lot done. 

<b> 11.14.22 - 11.18.22</b>: We attached the gussets and put the wheels on the trebuchet. Thankfully, it fits through the door! We got casters from theater tech, but were only able to find three matching ones, so the trebuchet is a little bit unstable at the moment. We are hoping to get similarly sized wheels to put on the back, and we have ordered bearings for the arm. These will hopefully arrive sometime next week, but we are essentially done with the frame, putting us right on schedule. 

<b> 11.28.22 - 12.2.22</b>: This week we got the bearings into the arm. This took slightly longer than expected. We drilled 2in holes into a piece of test wood, which fit the bearings very wel once the wood cooled. However, when we drilled holes of the same diameter into the arm itself, the bearings slid right through. We ended up having to glue them, and printed a small spacer to keep them from sliding towards the center of the beam. We also found that the piping was only nominally the size of the interior diameter of the bearing, and in reality was slightly narrower. The offset was a little less than 1mm in radius, so we printed inserts. Using these, we were able to friction fit the pieces on and fix the arm on its axis very well. We also cut small pieces of plywood to secure the bearings, so all we have left to do to finish the arm is attach those and stain it. 

<b> 12.4.22 - 12.9.22</b>: This week we stained the arm. We also 3D printed stop collars for the pipe that will hold the counterweight plates. Because we are still waiting on our last two wheels, and we haven't gotten the weight plates yet, we began working on the sliphook mechanism. We laser cut the plate with the adjustable slot for the sliphook, which we also 3D printed. The adjustable sliphook angle is very useful, but we may have to find a way to secure it more tightly, because the bolt doesn't hold it perfectly.
