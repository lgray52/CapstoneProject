### CAD imports
* Caster wheel CAD [file](https://www.mcmaster.com/caster-wheels/cart-smart-casters-with-rubber-wheels/)
* Ball bearing CAD [file](https://www.mcmaster.com/bearings/ball-bearings/ball-bearings-8/); for 1in diameter pipe R16
* Stop collar CAD [file](https://www.mcmaster.com/stop-collars/extra-grip-clamping-shaft-collars/); for 1in diameter pipe R16
* Screw Eye CAD [file](https://www.mcmaster.com/3016T14/): 

### Notes for document

* Material used for 2x4s is birch instead of the pine that will be used in real life
* Actual dimensions for 2 x 4 is 1.5 x 3.5in which was accounted for in design

## Prototype

Our first prototype is a 15:1 model. Despite popsicle sticks not being exactly proportional to the 2x4s we will use for the final product, we used our Onshape model to scale the dimensions as accurately as possible. 

<b>Dimensions:</b>

Base: 11.8cm x 7.2cm 

Height of frame : 11.1 cm

Height with arm fully extended: 21.8 cm

<img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/prototype1.jpg" height="300"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/prototype2.jpg" height="300"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/prototype3.jpg" height="300"> <img src="https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/images/prototype4.jpg" height="300">

We used a battery as the counterweight and attached it to the arm. The projectile was a small ball of paper covered in hot glue. One issue with prototyping with popsicle sticks was getting the arms of the frame to be exactly 30 degrees from the vertical. Because of this, we had to adjust the base dimensions and therefore they are not directly proportional to the base size we will use for the actual trebuchet. 

Our initial sliphook (a piece of wire) was too long which caused the sling to release too late. Our final sliphook was much shorter and was at about a 45 degree angle. The key was getting the sling to release before the arm was completely vertical at 0 degrees. 

We also had issues with the sling, because the pouch to hold the projectile was made of paper. Because the pouch did not really form around the projectile, it would slip out immediately. This problem should be solved with the actual trebuchet because the pouch will be made out of cloth. 

With the final product, our plan is to use stop collars to stop the trebuchet arm from moving horizontally along the axis. For the prototype, we put some hot glue on the axle (a q-tip stick) to minimize walking. 

## Frame

#### Initial design

Floating A-frame from pine 2x4 boards. Frame approximately 2m high excluding height of arm. 

Onshape Model: 09.27.22 : approximately 140lbs, 64in

### Purchased

Plywood base: 31.5 x 59.25 in (0.75 in thick)
Heavy duty caster wheels (x4)

#### Lumber (2x4)

* 60 in (X2)
* 59.25 in (x2)
* 55.75 in (x4)
* 34.5 in (x2)
* 59.25 in (x2)
* 31.5 in (x2)
* 34.5 in (x1)


## Arm and Counterweight

## Sling

## Weekly Reports

<b>10.3.22 - 10.7.22</b>: We built a 15:1 scale [prototype](https://github.com/lgray52/CapstoneProject/blob/main/README.md#prototype) out of popsicle sticks. Although we were using popsicle sticks, which don't directly translate to 2x4s, we used our onshape model to try and make the dimensions as accurate as possible. The end result launched a small projectile about 25 in. Our main issue was adjusting the slip hook so the sling would release at the correct time (at approx 45 degrees). We used a battery as the counterweight, so we tried using a slightly smaller counterweight, but this caused additional issues because it would not stay in the sling. This problem should be less of an issue with the full scale trebuchet, because we will be using cloth for the sling instead of paper, which didn't form around the projectile.
